        Naval battles in War Thunder plunge players into the unforgiving world
        of sea warfare, with a massive lineup of vessels ranging from nimble
        torpedo boats and coastal patrol craft to towering battleships bristling
        with guns that can level enemies from miles away. Every ship feels like
        its own beast to master, whether you’re weaving through enemy fire in a
        fragile speedboat or commanding a floating fortress that shakes the
        entire ocean when it fires a broadside.

        Players can engage in tense duels across open seas, sneak through narrow
        coastal channels, or rain destruction from afar in carefully coordinated
        bombardments. The maps span everything from island chains and arctic
        waters to tropical harbors and stormy oceans, each offering unique
        tactical challenges and environmental hazards. Realistic damage modeling
        means every shell, torpedo, and depth charge can turn the tide of
        battle, sometimes leading to heroic last stands and other times ending
        with your ship split in two beneath the waves.

        The progression system teases players with ever-larger ships, deadlier
        weapons, and advanced naval technology, ensuring the grind for supremacy
        never ends. Whether you’re drawn to the high-speed chaos of small-boat
        skirmishes, the devastating power of destroyers and cruisers, or the
        awe-inspiring might of battleships, War Thunder’s naval mode delivers an
        experience that blends strategy, chaos, and sheer firepower. It’s not
        just a sea battle—it’s a thunderous clash of steel and salt where glory
        and ruin ride the waves together.
